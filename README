This is my first attempt at:
 a game
 a game in canvas
 a game in canvas with CoffeeScript as the backend

It's a simple gallaga style shooter with most of the engine ripped from Seth Ladd's Bad Aliens demo he did.

Internal Workings:
- Most everything extends the Entity Class which is ticked inside the game engine.
- Hit detection is handled by each entity so that they can choose what other entities they want to interact with
  * makes it extremely modular
- Enemies are determined at random and are emplaced by the levels themselves
- I have no grasp on level, level management, and inter-level state (scrore screens, etc)

WARNING: The code isn't the best - it was more of a learning experience and a stepping stone into game development.
